The relative performance of OpenMP and STL threads can depend on various factors, and the specific behavior may vary based on the compiler, platform, and the nature of the algorithm being parallelized. Here are some reasons why the OpenMP implementation might be outperforming the STL thread implementation in this particular case:

1. **Thread Creation Overhead:**
   - OpenMP typically has lower thread creation overhead compared to the lower-level STL threads. OpenMP can efficiently manage the creation and synchronization of threads, which can lead to better performance in scenarios where the overhead of thread creation becomes a significant factor.

2. **Work-sharing Constructs:**
   - OpenMP provides higher-level work-sharing constructs like `#pragma omp parallel for`, which allows for a simpler expression of parallelism in certain loop structures. This can sometimes result in more efficient code generation by the compiler.

3. **Compiler Optimization:**
   - OpenMP implementations often come with more aggressive compiler optimizations, and compilers might be better at optimizing code with OpenMP directives than with lower-level thread management code.

4. **Synchronization Overhead:**
   - The OpenMP runtime may have more optimized mechanisms for thread synchronization compared to the STL threads. Efficient synchronization is crucial for good parallel performance, and differences in synchronization mechanisms can impact the overall performance.

5. **Memory Allocation:**
   - Memory allocation patterns, especially in parallel algorithms, can affect performance. OpenMP might have more efficient memory management strategies for certain scenarios.

6. **Compiler and Runtime Integration:**
   - OpenMP is often more tightly integrated with compilers and runtime libraries, allowing for better coordination between the compiler and the runtime system. This integration can lead to more effective optimization strategies.
